# TeamStandardsAndRules
This is where you'll learn about the standards and make your first PR using this organization's standards.

## STANDARDS
### Commits
We will be using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as our commit standards.
It is understood that this organization is used as a learning playground for these industry standards so mistakes WILL happen.
It is also understood that you will read the documentation to be sure you are doing the best for yourself and your peers.
