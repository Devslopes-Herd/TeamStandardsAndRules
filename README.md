# TeamStandardsAndRules

## Welcome! 
Reading this must mean that you've decided to join a Devslopes group project!
### You must be a member of the Devslopes-Herd and Devslopes Academy. You may not participate in this repo if you are not a member.

## First Steps
This readme file is short because there are two important documents that you *MUST* read.
We're excited for you to join and are ready to watch you grow and gain valuable experience.

1. Read the RULES.md.
2. Read and complete the tasks in STANDARDS.md. There are Loom links that accompany each task.
